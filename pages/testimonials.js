The transformation was very impressive. It was done quickly and correctly. High level of customer service and smooth communications. We’ve got few quotes before giving the job to Project landscape, they are not the cheapest amount all, but truly the highest value. We are very happy with the entire process and results."

              review="Project Landscape replaced all the surface boards on our 2-level deck and stairs with pressure treated boards. They also created some additional “walk ways” in our back yard by replacing grass with pea-gravel filled paths. Their workmanship and attention to detail was excellent, and they ensured that everything was “right”. Also appreciated their detailed quotation — really helped us to fine-tune the work we wanted done — and happily answered all our questions. Highly recommend these folks for deck design and installation."

The patio looks great! I was happy with how well they fit the blocks around the window well. I had to pick a bunch of rocks out of the lawn before I mowed, unfortunately, and there were skid marks left on the driveway from the bobcat."

There appeared to be some moments of miscommunication between some people at the company during the rush to get my project underway during a short window of good weather in the middle of many consecutive days of rain, but in the end, everyone at Project Landscape came through and did a fantastic job on my project. All the work was done in one day with a large team to take advantage of the good weather. Franz did a great job with his crew, and I am very happy with the results. Everything was built exactly as I wanted it, and there were zero deficiencies. I would gladly call them up again for my next project."

              review="Excellent and speedy work. Weather was a huge factor in our project and never seemed to work in our favor. However once the weather broke a full crew came to tackle our renovation. From removal of over grown weeds, patio installation, new sod, garden bed installation, trees being planted and walkway from side of house this work was done in 2 days. I was amazed at how quickly this was done maintaining the standard of work from the very beginning. Communication was a big plus for me as well as Alison in the office was always quick to reply and was very professional and a delight to talk to. We even had a change in design concept from our original plan after the work was done. The crew was able to come back out and fix this for us. Again very professional and quick. Scott and the team are amazing at what they do even advising on the best options for our space. I would not hesitate to hire them again for our next project."

              review="Scott’s crew worked on my yard when I moved into my house in 2017. They dug flower beds, planted shrubs and trees, installed a fire pit and supplied topsoil. In 2018 his carpenters designed and constructed a privacy screen/flower wall on one side of my deck. It holds 60 pots of fragrant blooms and looks fantastic. When one of my trees was bending dangerously Scott sent his men to stake it up at no charge. His company does quality work and the costs are reasonable. If I need any more landscaping done, I will call Project Landscape Ltd."

The price quoted was reasonable and Scott had great ideas and suggestions on how to make our yard most functional.
              We were working against the weather (this project was done in late October/November) but everything was completed as promised. They were patient and professional with us while we made several changes an inquiries along the way.
              Overall, we couldn’t be happier with the finished result. Excellent quality work! Done on time and on budget. We are more than satisfied!"

              review="Project Landscape Ltd. did an excellent job of landscaping my yard. Many things stood out that prompted me to take the time and write up a sincere and genuine 5-star review. I feel strongly that homeowners should consider Project Landscape for their landscaping needs, as this is the kind of business that I want to thrive and succeed in my hometown of Calgary. I am incredibly pleased with the way the conducted business and executed the work. I will definitely be ringing them up for any of my landscaping needs in the future. Project Landscape is in it to build relationships and gain return customers, which I appreciated. They demonstrated this by cleaning up, putting things back where they were supposed to go; these little things mattered. Ultimately I felt as though the end result was thorough and as if they were working on their own properties. As a first time house-owner (with a yard) I was pleased with Project Landscape!"

This transparency allowed us to make thoughtful adjustments based on our budget while maximizing our landscaping ideas. Scott was also very helpful, providing insight into design alternatives we hadn’t thought of, which turned out amazing. We managed to stay on budget and our completed project turned out better than we had imagined it could have. We enjoyed working with Scott and his team, they were personable and friendly, and easily made this project exciting and fun. We have since had many neighbours positively comment on our landscaping, which is satisfying for sure. We would definitely recommend Project landscape."

We did our research and got multiple quotes and we loved the initial interactions with the Project Landscape team. Very professional, came on-site, discussed various option on how to do the deck, gave input but also allowed our vision to come to life. Once the quote details were sorted they got to work quickly on our new deck. The removed the entire old deck, did some landscaping to make way for the new deck, had a friendly and courteous team in to build the new deck, with a super strong foundation. We also made some small changes mid-project to add more lighting which they were easily able to accommodate. During the process their team explained each step and kept us updated to what would happen next. This was great so we knew what was happening and how things were progressing. The entire project was wrapped up within a few weeks and was done so well, better than we even imagined! The job site was left nice and tidy, ready for us to use right away. I included some before and after images as well. It was a great experience and we’re so happy we went with the Project Landscape team for our new deck.

              The Project landscape was courteous to our
              neighbours and ensured that their lawn was
              unaffected. Everything turned out better than we were expecting. We love the final look of our yard.
              I would without a doubt recommend Project
              Landscape to anyone creating or redoing their
              yards. Should we ever need to landscape a yard again, we would definitely contact Scott and Alison.
              Again thank you!

              review="We had an outstanding experience with Project Landscape! Their team, led by Alison, Scott, and Ryan, along with their skilled contractors, demonstrated the utmost professionalism and accommodation throughout our project. Our house is a new build in a new area of the city so we planned for: - a new, bigger deck (composite decking)
              - landscaping rock
              - artificial turf
              - vinyl fencing
              Project Landscape was able to do it all for us and even when we made a few changes along the way, there were never any issues, it was always yup we can do that, no problem!. They were very accommodating to all our requests
              The transformation of our property exceeded our expectations, leaving us with a yard we are genuinely proud of, and even the neighbours have commented at how good everything looks. Kudos to Project Landscape for their exceptional service and a special shoutout to Alison, Scott, Ryan, and the entire team for their awesome work! Highly recommended!"
